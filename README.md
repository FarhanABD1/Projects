# My Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work in **Python-based data analytics** and **Power BI dashboards**. Each project demonstrates my ability to solve business challenges, perform data-driven analysis, and create actionable insights. Below are details on my two Python projects and two Power BI dashboards.

## üêç **Python Projects**

### 1. **LMIA Outcome Predictor**
- **Objective**: Predict Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) outcomes based on key features like job location, skill type, and employer category.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing for large datasets.
  - Machine learning models (Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
  - Model evaluation using \( R^2 \), MSE, and MAE.
- **Results**:
  - Ridge Regression achieved \( R^2 = 99.99\%\) on unseen data.
  - Identified actionable insights: Regions with labor shortages had 25% higher approval rates.
- **Usage**:
  - Clone the repository, and run the notebook to explore the full analysis and predictive models.

### 2. **Mortgage and Housing Market Analysis**
- **Objective**: Analyze trends in the housing market to identify key factors influencing mortgage approvals and pricing.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Features**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in house prices and mortgage rates.
  - Regression models to predict house prices based on economic and property features.
  - Data visualization for key metrics and trends.
- **Results**:
  - Discovered a strong correlation between interest rates and mortgage approval rates.
  - Regression models achieved \( R^2 = 92.5\%\) on test data.
- **Usage**:
  - Run the notebook to explore insights and predictions for the housing market.

### 2. **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Dashboard**
- **Objective**: Track and analyze diversity metrics for AGPharma to ensure alignment with DEI goals.
- **Key Features**:
  - Visualizations of workforce composition by gender, ethnicity, and role.
  - KPIs: Gender balance, retention rates, and inclusivity metrics by department.
  - Drill-through functionality for in-depth analysis of DEI initiatives.
- **Results**:
  - Highlighted departments needing DEI focus, leading to policy updates that improved workforce diversity by 15%.
- **Usage**:
  - Import the `.pbix` file into Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard.
